<div class="container text-center">
  <p>Hi there <%= @resource.email %>!</p>

  <p>Someone (we're not pointing any fingers) has requested a link to change your password. If you recognize this request, you can do this through the link below.</p>

  <p><%= link_to 'Change my password', edit_password_url(@resource, reset_password_token: @token) %></p>

  <p>If you didn't request this, don't do anything!</p>
  <p>Your password won't change until you access the link above and create a new one.</p>
